# Use-My-Tools-CSR
Use My Tools is a rental marketplace where individuals can find and rent tools owned by people nearby. It's a great way to save money when you need a tool for one project and it's not worth buying one.

The root directory contains backend (server and database) code as well as the use-my-tools React App, which contains the front end (client app) code.

I'm setting up a postgres database and creating/running migrations using knex. 

I'll use an express server for dev before deploying to Heroku.
