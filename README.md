# Use-My-Tools-CSR
My version of Build Week 1 Project

The root directory contains backend (server and database) code as well as the user-my-tools React App, which contains the front end (client app) code.

I'm setting up a postgres database and creating/running migrations using knex. 

I'll use an express server for dev before deploying to Heroku.
